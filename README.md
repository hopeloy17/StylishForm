Stylish Multi-Step Form
This project is a responsive, two-step form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form uses a sliding animation to transition between pages, providing a modern and user-friendly experience.

Features:
  Multi-step form with smooth sliding transitions
  Custom styled input fields and buttons
  Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  Shows/hides navigation and submit buttons based on the current step
  
How it works:
  Page 1: Collects user name and email
  Page 2: Collects message subject and message, with options to go back or submit
  P.S Doesn't actually submit the form (just clickable)
  
Technologies Used:
  HTML5
  CSS3 (with custom background and transitions)
  Vanilla JavaScript (for navigation logic)

Personal Experince gained:
  Put the little javascript I learnt into practice
